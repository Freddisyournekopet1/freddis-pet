During weeks 46 & 47 you will present your poetry/lyric analysis in smaller groups. This will take three classes but since you will only be active in the classroom during one of these classes you will be asked to do the following while someone else is presenting. During the two classes when you are not presenting you are going to kickstart the new project on Thanksgiving. 

What to do:

Watch the two short videos and answer the questions attached. 
Read the first two articles and take notes while reading. It is of great importance that you actually take notes on what you read because you will use these articles as sources for an argumentative text that you are going to write.

Here is the material: 

Thanksgiving

What do you know about Thanksgiving? Do you know that there are more than one story to why Americans celebrate the holiday? In this project you are going to find out more about this American holiday and then write an argumentative text about it. 

Watch these two clips and think about the following, take notes to bring to class:
How does the information in the clips differ from each other?
Why do you think they differ?
How do we know what really happened?


 



 




2) Read these articles that are about Thanksgiving and the history of Thanksgiving. While reading, take notes on important names, places, dates and events. You are going to use them to write a text.
